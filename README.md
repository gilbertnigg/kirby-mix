# Composerkit

**Kirby: the CMS that adapts to any project, loved by developers and editors alike.** The Composerkit is a minimal plainkit for Kirby that uses Composer to manage its dependencies. It uses our recommended public folder setup. All files stored or generated by Kirby, such as content, accounts, cache, sessions, logs, etc., are organised in the data folder. It is the ideal choice if you are already working with Composer and more complex setups and are looking for a solid boilerplate.

You can learn more about Kirby at [getkirby.com](https://getkirby.com).
